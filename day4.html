    <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum in Agra, India, commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1631 to house the tomb of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and also his own tomb. Considered a masterpiece of Mughal architecture and a symbol of love, its construction was completed in 1648. The complex includes the main mausoleum, red sandstone buildings, and a "charbagh" Persian-style garden. </p>
    <h3>History of Construction</h3>
    <p>The inspiration for the Taj Mahal was a verse by Bibadal Khan, the imperial goldsmith and poet. The vision behind the construction was to make an earthly replica of Mumtaz Mahal’s celestial abode in paradise. The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the complex—main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets)—were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration. Building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.</p>

    <p>The Agra Fort (Qila Agra) is a historical Mughal fort in the city of Agra, also known as Agra's Red Fort. Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned at this fort in 1530. It was later renovated by the Mughal emperor Akbar from 1565 and the present-day structure was completed in 1573. It served as the main residence of the rulers of the Mughal dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the "Lal-Qila" or "Qila-i-Akbari".[1] Before being captured by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its importance during Mughal rule.[2] It is about 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city. It was later renovated by Shah Jahan. </p>
    <p>Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud of Ghazni's invasion is unclear. However, in the 15th century, the Chauhan‌ Rajputs ‌occupied ‌it. ‌Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Khan Lodi (1487–1517 CE) shifted‌ his‌ capital‌ from ‌Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the preexisting fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (1526 CE), Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In 1530 CE, Humayun was crowned in it. The fort was given its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (1556–1605 CE). Later, this fort was under the rule of Jats ‌of Bharatpur for 13 years. </p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.[3]Diwan-i-Aam, Hall of Public Audience.Realising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital, and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan.[4] Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.[5][6] </p>

    <p>The Red Fort is a historic fort in Delhi, India, built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the mid-1600s, which served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly two centuries.

Today, it is a major tourist attraction and the site of the annual Independence Day flag-hoisting ceremony.  </p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The Red Fort's history began with its construction by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1639 to serve as the new palace for his capital, Shahjahanabad (now Old Delhi).

Named for its massive red sandstone walls, it became a symbol of Mughal power and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
